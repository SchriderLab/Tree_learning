# Tree topology inference from multiple sequence alignments using Deep Learning

This repository contains R and Phython scripts that were used in the project ["Accurate inference of tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments using deep learning"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/559054v1) 

R scripts can be found in INDELible directory. They will generate various control files for [INDElible](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/indelible/) program that simulates MSAs under given tree topology, branch lengths and different substitution as well as indel model parameters.  

Required R packages:  
[phangorn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phangorn/index.html)   
[MCMCpack](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCpack/index.html)  
[dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)  
[scales](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/index.html)
